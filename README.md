- 👋 Hi, I’m @CipherSecPro
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security and Coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whaterver comes in the course of study focusing on CompTIA Security+ certification and Coding (python).
- 💞️ I'm not currently seeking collaborations; I'm in the learning phase. However, if you share the belief in the power of unity and think we can learn together, feel free to hit me up. Let's raise a virtual toast to knowledge! 🥂 #LearningJourney
- 📫 How to reach me vucyberlearner@gmail.com
- I'm in a committed relationship with success, but my lazy side keeps trying to set me up with its cousin, 'Comfortable Couch.' Somehow, I'll convince success to join the party. 🛋️🎉
